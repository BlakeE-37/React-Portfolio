# React Portfolio

## Description
This project is a personal portfolio I made using the JavaScript library, React. I made this portfolio to updgrade my static website portfolio as well as to show my knowledge in React and React functionality. This website has a brief discription of myself, links to six of my other web developement projects, a contact form to display the use of state in my react app, and an image, and link to download my resume.
